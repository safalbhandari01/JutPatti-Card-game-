About the game: 

Jut Patti is a card game where the player or a computer whoever first manages to collect a pair for each card on their hand wins the game.

In the beginning an odd number of shuffled cards is assigned to each player by the computer.

After that, the first player gets a card from the deck. The player’s objective is to check the card he got from the deck to the ones on the hand and if there is a card on his hand with the same face value of the card then put the card from the deck on his hand and create a pair. Then the player has to throw a card from his hand that is not a pair. That concludes the turn of the first player.

After that, the next player has the liberty to look at the card thrown by the player before and if it matches to the face value of one of the cards on his hand, pick it up and add it to his hand other wise pick up a card from the deck of cards. The player has to throw a card at the end of his turn. 

After that, it is next player’s turn. After completion of the turn of each player, it is first players turn again. The game goes on until one of the players has a pair for each card he has on his hand. 

For example, if 5 cards are dealt by computer to each player at the beginning of the game. A player only wins the game by picking a card and making 3 pair of cards on his hand.

The same logic is implemented for the computer player where computer player plays with the opponent picking a card from deck or the one thrown by the opponent and creating a pair of n/2 cards to win the game (if n card is distributed at first).
